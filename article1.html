          The automotive world is experiencing the most substantial change since Henry Ford industrialized manufacturing a century ago.
          It`s important that the current transformation is triggered not only by extensive technology development but also by social demand.
          It appears that our future will be all about accessible mobility: mobility solutions will be more flexible, individualized, and compatible.
          Let`s consider what innovations are driving this new automotive revolution.

        <h2>An Overview of the Latest Automotive Industry Trends</h2>
        <div class="centered">
          <p>The present-day automotive industry is affected by innovative ideas and is ready to transform and evolve rapidly.
            Current ecological, social, and technological trends are encouraging automotive manufacturers to offer consumers much more than a metal box on four wheels.
            Whereas for the past 100 years, carmakers were largely focused on enhancing manufacturing to become more efficient at scale,
            the future is about redefining the role of the vehicle - now it1s rather a smartphone or computer on wheels.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            New technology in the automotive industry opens up new opportunities. AI, additive manufacturing, the Internet of Things,
            and 5G have become sources of product innovation and manufacturing efficiency, which in turn has led to revolutionary changes in customer experience.
          </p>
            
          <p>In recent years, the automotive industry has been affected by the following trends:</p>

        <h2>Future Trends in the Automotive Industry: 2024 Outlook</h2>
        <div class="centered">
          <p>
            We expect to see the following automobile trends next year:
          </p>
          <div class="ordered_list">
            <ol>
              <li>Electric Cars
                <p>
                  The worldwide shift to electric cars is one of the most prominent trends in automobile industry.
                  Environmental factors have driven the growth of zero-emission vehicle technology, and the popularity of cleaner and more environmentally
                  friendly electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is still increasing. The battery technology and charging infrastructure
                  required for electric vehicles are also evolving - for example, lithium-ion batteries that have certain limitations can now be replaced by solid-state batteries
                  that have higher energy density, are safer, more stable, and cost-effective.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>Self-Driving Vehicles
                <p>
                  Innovative manufacturers take considerable interest in the potential of self-driving technology since it opens new opportunities for business growth.
                  Up-to-date, autonomous vehicles are in the early stage of development: among the 6 levels of driving automation,
                  there are only Level 3 (conditional automation) and some Level 4 (high driving automation) vehicles available in some regions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Despite the fact that fully autonomous driving is at least several years away from the present, in 2024 and beyond,
                  this technology is expected to be actively developed and tested, and the number of autonomous cars on roads will increase.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS)
                <p>
                  Mobility-as-a-Service has been among the latest trends in automotive industry for some years - it has become a popular
                  convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional car ownership and personal vehicles.
                  The technology involves the integration of diverse transportation means into a single platform for delivering all-embracing mobility services.
                  The platforms may include public transportation, taxis, micromobility vehicles, car leases, or their combinations.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>Alternative Fuels
                <P>
                  This is one of the new trends in automotive industry, which is to some extent in conflict with electrification.
                  However, there are still a great number of fuel-driven cars, and despite the shift to producing electric vehicles,
                  some car manufacturers don`t want to use batteries in their automobiles for some reasons. So, the so-called e-fuels become a greener
                  alternative to traditional fuel, which is also used beyond the automotive industry. E-fuels embrace e-kerosene, e-methane,
                  or e-methanol which are produced as a result of synthesizing CO2 emissions and using renewable CO2-free electricity.
                </P>
              </li>

              <li>Automotive Supply Chain Issues
                <p>
                  The automotive industry is one of the most severely affected by supply chain disruptions. Currently,
                  its greatest challenge is instability, which is expected to persist next year. This is explained by several factors.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Talent shortages: automotive manufacturers suffer from high employee turnover, which continues to decline;
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    The shift to electric vehicles and incorporation of advanced features in vehicles;
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Reliance on global supply chains;
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Geopolitical tensions.
