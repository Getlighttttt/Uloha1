          One of the biggest challenges facing the automotive industry in recent years has been
          environmental concerns such as air pollution and climate change.
          In response, many car manufacturers have invested heavily in developing electric and hybrid vehicles.

        <h2>Environmental Concerns: The Challenges and Opportunities of Electric Cars</h2>
        <div class="centered">
          <p>
              Electric cars offer a number of advantages over traditional gasoline-powered cars,
              including lower emissions and reduced dependence on fossil fuels.
              However, there are also challenges associated with electric cars, such as the limited range of current battery technology
              and the need for a charging infrastructure.
          </p>

        </figure>

        <div class="centered">
          <p>
              Despite these challenges, electric cars are becoming increasingly popular,
              and many experts believe they represent the future of the automotive industry.
          </p>

          <p>
              In addition to electric cars, there are other emerging technologies that are expected to have a significant
              impact on the automotive industry. For example, self-driving cars are being developed by several companies,
              and are expected to revolutionize the way we travel in the future. Other technologies, such as 3D printing and augmented reality,
              are also being explored for their potential applications in the automotive industry.

            Environmental Concerns:
          </p>
          <div class="ordered_list">
            <ol>
              <li>
                Carbon Emissions: The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide,
                accounting for nearly 25% of global CO₂ emissions. Traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles release significant amounts of CO₂,
                nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, contributing to air pollution and global warming
              </li>

              <li>
                Resource Depletion: Manufacturing vehicles, especially those with internal combustion engines,
                requires large amounts of raw materials such as steel, aluminum, and plastics derived from petroleum.
                The extraction and processing of these materials have environmental consequences, including deforestation, habitat destruction,
                and water pollution
              </li>

              <li>
                End-of-Life Disposal: The disposal of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) is another significant environmental concern.
                Many cars end up in landfills or scrap yards where hazardous substances,
                including battery acids, oils, and other fluids, can leach into the environment

          <div class="ordered_list">
            <ol>
              <li>
                Reduced Emissions: Electric vehicles (EVs) offer the potential for significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles.
                While emissions are generated during the manufacturing of EVs, especially in battery production,
                the use phase produces little to no emissions, particularly when charged using renewable energy sources
              </li>

              <li>
                Energy Efficiency: EVs are much more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles.
                Electric motors convert over 77% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels, whereas conventional gasoline engines only
                convert about 12%-30% of the energy stored in gasoline to power the vehicle
              </li>

              <li>
                Advancements in Battery Technology: One of the primary challenges of electric vehicles is the environmental impact of battery production,
                particularly the mining of lithium, cobalt, and nickel. However,
                advancements in battery recycling technologies and the development of solid-state batteries offer the promise of reducing the ecological
                footprint of EVs while improving energy density and range .
              </li>

              <li>
                Support for Renewable Energy: EVs can act as mobile storage units for renewable energy through vehicle-to-grid
                (V2G) technology, helping to stabilize power grids by storing excess energy generated from solar or wind and releasing it when demand is high .
              </li>

              <li>
                Economic and Regulatory Support: Governments across the globe are setting aggressive targets for the adoption of electric vehicles.
                For instance, the EU plans to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. Various countries offer subsidies, tax incentives,
                and investments in EV charging infrastructure to accelerate the transition .

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="centered">
          <p>The transition to electric vehicles presents an opportunity to significantly reduce the environmental impact of personal transportation.
            However, to fully realize these benefits, challenges related to battery production, disposal, and energy infrastructure must be addressed.
            Encouraging developments in battery recycling, renewable energy integration,
            and government policy support are paving the way for a more sustainable future
